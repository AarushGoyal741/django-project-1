# Django Hello World 🌐

This is a multi-page Django web application built during my exploration of backend development using the Django framework.

## 📋 Project Description

In this Django project, I learned how to:
- Take various types of user inputs through forms
- Save the submitted data into a backend database
- Retrieve and analyze the data for future use
- Create multiple navigable pages (like **Contact Us**, etc.)
- Embed images into pages and design basic layouts

The project serves as a foundational learning app for full-stack web development using Python and Django.
